=====================
The virtual robot arm
=====================

The virtual arm is stored in a different repository `qiuwch/UE4VirtualArm <https://github.com/qiuwch/UE4VirtualArm>`__. This is because the 3D CAD models are very large. This repository is still in private mode, because we are still finializing the design and will release it together with a publication. If you are interested in this project, please send an email to qiuwch@gmail.com to request access.

A compiled virtual arm binary can be downloaded.

- `Linux version <https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~qiuwch/release/UE4VirtualArm-linux.zip>`__
