Spread-3.15.2 Version 1.04
=====================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Spread-3.15.2-1.04 is a Perl module that conveniently wraps the Spread C
libraries provided with the Spread 3.15.2 distribution.  Spread is available at
http://www.spread.org/.  Spread is a local/wide area group communication
toolkit that runs on most modern operating systems.  It allows convenient
mechanisms for reliable multicasting information between applications as well
as providing many more complicate assurances.

CHANGES
-------

Version 3.15.2-1.04 adds a MANFIEST, dist to Makefile.PL, and several spelling
corrections.  The only used code change was the spelling correction of CAUSAL.

Version 3.15.2-1.03 updgrades the xs code to use the 3.15.2 Spread client
libraries.

Version 3.14-1.03 fixes a long standing mortilzation bug that caused an abusive
memory leak on systesm with many message.  The leak was in SP_receive. It also
adds this "changes" section.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Spread-3.15.2-1.04 requires the Spread group communication toolkit daemon and
client C libraries (with headers) to be installed (or compiled) on the system.

It will often not work correctly if there is an older libsp installed on the
system.

It also request Perl 5.

INSTALLATION
