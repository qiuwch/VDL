Features, ideas, and other things that might get done.
Those ending with (*break) break binary,source or client-server compatability
------------------------------------------------------
* Allow entire class C subnet to be in config file--as long as no more then 128 are active.
* Improve stability under high load

* Fix all recv calls in session.c so that they handle partial or EAGAIN 
  recv calls and store the data received so far and try again.
* Fix sends (currently they might be ok) to handle EAGAIN, EWOULDBLOCK, EINTR, ENOBUFS
* Fix sp.c to not close sockets that have errors except in SP_disconnect. (*break)

* Change max buffered message limit to be not just num messages, but also size, or other parameters.
* Make this runtime configurable.

* Fix partial DOS when someone connects and doesn't send anything (the 1 second delay)
* Add enhanced alarm() subsystem
* Merge cleanup of session layer from research branch

* Once ses ids are non-volatile (fix for session_index on windows) have group 
  struct store ses instead of mbox and then just copy it once in 
  G_analize_group instead of O(Gsize) Sess_get_session_index() calls.

* Merge Cristinas work. (*break)
* Veryify that all public defines/functions/datatypes are namespace clean. (*break)
* Make various binary packages available (rpm, deb, pkg, ...)

* Figure out hanging bug with max ARU window reported by Tom Mornini & co.
* Decide what to do with multipath patch from Marc Zyngier

* Add Yair's fix for delayed tokens. (*break)
* Add Cristina's accessor functions for Membership message fields. (*break)
